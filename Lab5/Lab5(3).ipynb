    "# Lab Five: Evaluation and Multi-Layer Perceptron\n",

    "## Preparation and Overview\n",
    "1.1 Explain the task and what business-case or use-case it is designed to solve (or designed to investigate). Detail exactly what the task is and what parties would be interested in the results. How well would your prediction algorithm need to perform to be considered useful by interested parties?\n",
    "\n",
    "For manufacturers in steel industries, producing defected products means loss of benefits. If they can find a way to figure out the steel plates faults, they will be able to locate the exact problems that defect their product. Traditional ways to do determination of steel plates faults includes scratching part of products and test it in laboratories, but this cost so much money. Steel plates faults may be the result of problematic production lines, and once we find out the class of certain steel plates faults, we can go back to the blueprint of production line and adjust it. As a manufacturer, this is a much better alternative than laboratory method, because classification by table data cost much less. \n",
    "\n",
    "What we want to do here is to determine steel plates faults with 27 independent attributes of steel plates. And steel plates faults will be classified to 7 distinct classes. The 7 classes are Pastry, Z_Scratch, K_Scatch, Stains, Dirtiness, Bumps, and Other_Faults.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steel is primary raw material for various industries, and Medical Industry has high demand for high quality steel. Obviously people cannot endure dcotors use scalpels with stains to do surgery. Craftmen need to polish the instruments to make them gain resistance to corrosion.(http://www.teleflex.com/en/usa/pdf/KMedic_Surgical_Instruments_101.pdf) Craftmen really want their raw material as clean as possible, so that they don't have to waste much time on preprocessing steel plates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our target parties will be Medical Companies which produce medical instruments. For these companies, accuracy and precision of our algorithm will be the first parameter they will consider in the first place. Obviously 100% accurate will be our expectation, but when we come back to reality, an accuracy higher than 90% will be enough for them to enhance their efficiency in medical instrument production."

Classes in our dataset is not evenly distributed, while pastry is the fault that takes place in about 660 cases, and bumps only take less than 100 cases. So we need a metric that can represent their weight and show us their effects to the performance.\n",

    "Additionally, higher f1-score mean lower false-negative and false positive, and it doesn't care about true negative. In our business case of Medical Industry, we really care about how many mistakes our algorithm makes, rather than how many successful predictions it makes. Because any mis-classification of fault type will cause extra time to fix it.\n",
